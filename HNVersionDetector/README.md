# HNVersionDetector

HNVersionDetector is a small program that you can use to detect on which version you are playing Hello Neighbor on.

It can be pretty useful for speedrunners and/or developers who want a consistent way to find the game version.

This can also be used to know if a build is new or not without having to search for in game differences.

Feel free to make Pull Requests to the VersionDatabase.cs if you want to add new builds.
